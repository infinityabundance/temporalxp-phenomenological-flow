## About

This work develops a structural account of phenomenological flow
grounded in irreversible time. Temporal experience is derived from
commitment succession, where commitments are formalized as persistent
reductions of admissible futures within a partially ordered constraint
topology.

Strict monotonic contraction induces asymmetric continuation
conditions, generating the directional character of experienced flow.
Distortions of felt duration arise from divergence between metric
duration and accumulated state-space reduction. Identity continuity is
defined as preservation of constraint topology across succession.

The framework is substrate-neutral and does not depend on biological,
psychological, or implementation-specific assumptions.
